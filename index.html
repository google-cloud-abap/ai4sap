            <h2>An overview page that talks about the features of Vertex AI SDK for ABAP, with a Get Started button to start with the HAZMAT use case.</h2> 
            <p>
                Vertex AI SDK for ABAP is a powerful tool that lets you seamlessly interact with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform programmatically using ABAP code. The SDK offers simplifications to how you interact with the Vertex AI API, and hence significantly reduces the complexity and amount of code you need to write to access Vertex AI API from your ABAP environment.
